A small AI project for my master class of AI.
It's a game, in which principles of Artificial Intelligence are applied and developed.
The environment of the game is a museum of famous paintings, which exhibits paintings of imperialism and surrealism. The players are 2 and are purely Artificial Intelligent Agencies, the main player (Player) who secretly enters the museum and tries to see all the desired paintings without being caught by his enemy (Enemy), who works for the security of the museum and moves randomly controlling the entire museum throughout the game

In the present work there are only 2 players who have the exact opposite goals. That is, the victory of one means the failure of the other. Appropriate methods were developed for both agents in order to monitor their progress in the game by the user. Therefore, depending on different characteristics and under different circumstances, either one player or the other wins.

Platform: Unity
PL: C#
